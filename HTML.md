## HTML 5

### New features in HTML 5?
New tags/elements:
- ```<header>```
- ```<nav>```
- ```<section>```
- ```<aside>```

```preventDefault()``` - prevents the default behavior of HTML and events in connection with forms submitted.


### Difference between inline and inline-block elements?
```display: inline-block;``` allows to set a *width* and *height* on the element.<br/>
```display: inline;``` - can't define *width* and *height* on the element.
